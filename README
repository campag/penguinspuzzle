REBUILD
1) mkdir /opt/vc/src/hello_pi/penguinspuzzle
2) Copy all files into this directory.
3) cd /opt/vc/src/hello_pi/penguinspuzzle
4) make
5) ./penguinspuzzle.bin

Note that this relies on the makefiles included with the standard Raspberry Pi releases so this process will not work in a different directory location.
